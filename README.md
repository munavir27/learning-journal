# Learning Journal

Hi, I'm Munavir, 22 years old and currently working in IT as a Technical Support Analyst.  

I don’t have advanced technical skills yet, but I know how to analyze problems, identify vulnerabilities, resolve issues, and lead a team. I prefer practical learning over theory and I always focus on understanding the fundamentals and the “why” behind everything I study.  

Starting today, I’m dedicating the next two years to building a strong foundation in technology, communication, and business skills. This repository will be my daily journal, where I share notes, progress, and reflections on what I learn.

## My Plan for Upskilling

1. Develop expertise in **cybersecurity** (first defensive, then offensive).  
2. Build a **personal brand** through content creation (mainly LinkedIn).  
3. Explore and understand the **skills of digital marketing**.  
4. Master **soft skills**.  
5. Master **sales, communication, and English fluency**.  
6. Learn **NEPQ sales techniques** (Jeremy Miner style).  
7. Apply learning directly to **real-world challenges**, not just theory.

## Why this journal exists
This journal is my daily record of learning, challenges, and growth. Every day I will:  
- Write short notes about what I learned.  
- Commit updates to GitHub.  
- Reflect on my progress.  

This is the start of my journey to grow from beginner to professional, and eventually to build a successful career and personal brand.
