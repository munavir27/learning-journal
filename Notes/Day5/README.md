# ðŸ”¥ Day 5 â€“ Networking Fundamentals  

**Focus:** Learning how Linux systems communicate over a network and practicing essential networking commands.  

---

## What I Learned  

- A **network** connects machines, like roads between houses.  
- **IP address** = the house number of your machine.  
- **Port** = a specific door for services (e.g., port 80 = web).  
- **Protocol** = the language used to communicate (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.).  
- Key commands practiced:  
  - `ip a` â†’ find your IP address.  
  - `ping` â†’ test connectivity to a host.  
  - `nslookup` â†’ resolve domain names to IPs.  
  - `traceroute` â†’ trace the path packets take.  
  - `netstat -tuln` â†’ list open ports and services.  
- Networking is the foundation of cybersecurity since attackers exploit open ports and defenders monitor traffic.
