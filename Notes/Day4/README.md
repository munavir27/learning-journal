# ðŸ”¥ Day 4 â€“ Processes and Monitoring

**Focus:** Learning how to manage processes in Linux, monitor system activity, and simulate real-world incident response.  

---

## What I Learned
- A **process** is a running program, each with a unique PID (Process ID).  
- **Foreground process** = runs in front of you.  
- **Background process** = runs silently while you continue working.  
- Key commands:  
  - `ps aux | less` â†’ snapshot of running processes.  
  - `top` â†’ live activity monitoring.  
  - `htop` â†’ advanced, colorful process monitor.  
  - `ping <target>` â†’ start a foreground process.  
  - `ping <target> &` â†’ run in background.  
  - `kill <PID>` â†’ stop a process.  
  - `kill -9 <PID>` â†’ force kill.  
- Attackers may hide malicious processes, so defenders must spot and eliminate them.
