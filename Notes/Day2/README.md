# ðŸ”¥ Day 2 â€“ Files and Permissions

**Focus:** Learning how to create, edit, read, and secure files in Linux.  

---

## What I Learned
- A file is like a scroll of knowledge.  
- A folder is like a treasure chest holding scrolls.  
- Permissions define who can read, write, or execute.  
- Learned key commands:  
  - `touch` â†’ create files.  
  - `nano` â†’ edit files.  
  - `cat` â†’ read files.  
  - `ls -l` â†’ check permissions.  
  - `chmod` â†’ change permissions.  
- Securing files with `chmod 600` ensures only the owner has control.
