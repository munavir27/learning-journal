# ðŸ”¥ Day 3 â€“ Users and Groups

**Focus:** Learning how Linux manages users and groups, and how permissions change with administrative powers.  

---

## What I Learned
- A **user** is like a citizen of the kingdom, each with a name, home, and powers.  
- A **group** is like a guild, multiple users can share permissions.  
- The **king (root)** is the superuser who can do anything.  
- Learned key commands:  
  - `whoami` â†’ check current user.  
  - `groups` â†’ see group memberships.  
  - `id` â†’ check UID and GID.  
  - `sudo adduser <name>` â†’ create a new user.  
  - `su <name>` â†’ switch to another user.  
  - `sudo usermod -aG sudo <name>` â†’ give a user sudo powers.  
- New users cannot run admin commands until added to the `sudo` group.
