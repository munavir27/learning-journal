# ðŸ”¥ Day 1 â€“ Welcome to the Terminal

**Focus:** Understanding Linux basics through terminal commands.  

**What I Learned**  
- The terminal is more powerful than GUI, it gives direct control.  
- Commands learned: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`.  
- Practiced creating and deleting folders like building a castle and tearing it down.  
- Learned that `rmdir` only deletes empty folders.
